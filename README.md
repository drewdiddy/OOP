All apps utilize OpenGL
Lab 1 is a shapes builder depicting my nickname
Lab 2 uses shapes to create a 1 or 2 player tic tac toe game
Lab 3 is a limited recreation of MS paint (using the colors red, green, and blue. Black for erase)
Lab 4 is an example of how to use text and shapes in the same scene
Lab 5 is an animated scene
Lab 6 is a more advanced way to use animation with coding logic
My final project is a recreation of the classic game: Frogger.
